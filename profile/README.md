## These repositories
Here you can find our bioinformatical pipelines (including QC), some default scripts, descriptions of datasets and presentations. On top of that you can find the scripts for our publications.

## Future plans
It would be great if we could add publications to a reppository as well as a shared knowledge base repository.
