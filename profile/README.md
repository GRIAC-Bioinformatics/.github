# Groningen Research Institute for Asthma and COPD (griac)
This is the GitHub page of the GRIAC at the University of Groningen (RUG) and University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) in the Netherlands and is part of Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration (GUIDE). The official website of the GRIAC is located at [UMCG.nl](https://www.umcg.nl/nl/web/research/w/griac), and more information can be found at [RUG.nl](https://research.rug.nl/en/organisations/groningen-research-institute-for-asthma-and-copd-griac).

## These repositories
Here you can find our bioinformatical pipelines (including QC), some default scripts, descriptions of datasets and presentations. On top of that you can find the scripts for our publications.

## Future plans
It would be great if we could add publications to a reppository as well as a shared knowledge base repository.
